Intro Related to Graph and Tree 
Basic Terminology:

Node and Edges
1->2->3
: 1,2,3 are nodes
: 1-> 2 edge // Unidirectional Edge

Tree : Graph without Cycle
Graph : Having Tree

: Tree having N nodes then it will have n-1 edges.

Connected and unConnected Component

Acyclic and Cyclic
: Acyclic Undirected Graph -> Tree
: DACyclic or UDAG -> Graph

Strongly Connected Component
: A strongly connected component is the portion of a directed graph 
  in which there is a path from each vertex to another vertex. 
  It is applicable only on a directed graph.

" Collection of all the components of Graphs is called Forest."

Leaf Node : Having no child node
Height of a Tree : max distance from root node to leaf node.
Depth of a Tree : Distance between a[i] node from root node
LCA : Fisrt Common Ancestor of two or more node
